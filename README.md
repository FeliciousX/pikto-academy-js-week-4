# 1. DOM in a nutshell

- DOM stands for Document Object Model (DOM)
- It's a tree like structure.. which is why people call it DOM Nodes.
- The DOM is a fully object-oriented representation of the web page, and it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
- Although the DOM is often accessed using JavaScript, it is not a part of the JavaScript language. It can also be accessed by other languages.
